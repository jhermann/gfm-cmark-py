cmark-gfm for Debian
--------------------

cmark is the C reference implementation of CommonMark, a rationalized
version of Markdown syntax with a spec.

It provides a shared library (libcmark) with functions for parsing
CommonMark documents to an abstract syntax tree (AST), manipulating
the AST, and rendering the document to HTML, groff man, LaTeX, CommonMark,
or an XML representation of the AST. It also provides a command-line
program (cmark) for parsing and rendering CommonMark documents.

Advantages of this library:

* Portable:

    The library and program are written in standard C99 and have no
    external dependencies. They have been tested with MSVC, gcc, tcc,
    and clang.

* Fast:

    cmark can render a Markdown version of War and Peace in the blink
    of an eye (127 milliseconds on a ten year old laptop, vs. 100-400
    milliseconds for an eye blink). In our benchmarks, cmark is 10,000
    times faster than the original Markdown.pl, and on par with the
    very fastest available Markdown processors.

* Accurate:

    The library passes all CommonMark conformance tests.

* Standardized:

    The library can be expected to parse CommonMark the same way as any
    other conforming parser. So, for example, you can use commonmark.js
    on the client to preview content that will be rendered on the server
    using cmark.

* Robust:

    The library has been extensively fuzz-tested using american fuzzy lop.
    The test suite includes pathological cases that bring many other
    Markdown parsers to a crawl (for example, thousands-deep nested
    bracketed text or block quotes).

* Flexible:

    CommonMark input is parsed to an AST which can be manipulated program-
    matically prior to rendering.

* Multiple renderers:

    Output in HTML, groff man, LaTeX, CommonMark, and a custom XML format
    is supported. And it is easy to write new renderers to support other
    formats.

* Free:

    BSD2-licensed.
